# CS330SNHUProject
Computational Graphic and Visualization
Designing software involves an iterative process of planning, prototyping, testing, and refining. My approach begins with understanding the requirements and objectives of the project, followed by breaking down the tasks into manageable components.
I adhered to a structured design process that included the following steps: requirement Analysis, which involved Identifying and documenting the key features and constraints. Followed by a system design which is developing system architecture and component interactions and creating initial prototypes to test design feasibility. Feedback and Iteration which involves refining the design based on test results and lastly, user feedback as well as finalizing and implementing the design in code. 
In terms of applying tactics from my design approach in my future work, I focus on emphasizing modularity and scalability which can be applied to any software project, ensuring easier maintenance and adaptability. Iterative testing and user feedback are universally beneficial tactics that will enhance the quality of future projects. Developing programs involves a combination of clear goal setting, structured planning, and iterative development. I focus on writing clean, readable code with detailed comments to ensure maintainability. Testing and debugging are integral parts of my development cycle to ensure the program meets the intended functionality
 During this project, I explored new development strategies such as employing efficient rendering techniques and optimizing graphical performance. I also utilized libraries and frameworks to manage complex 3D transformations and lighting effects, enabling a more dynamic and realistic visualization. Iteration was critical to my development process. Each stage of development involved cycles of testing, analyzing results, and making improvements. This approach ensured that any issues were addressed promptly and that the final product met all project requirement
Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved to include more structured planning and the use of advanced debugging tools. I also started incorporating peer feedback earlier in the process and relying more on automated testing to catch errors efficiently. Computer science equips me with the skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. By understanding algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking, I can apply these principles to achieve my career and educational aspirations, especially in technology-driven fields.
Computational graphics and visualizations have deepened my understanding of rendering techniques, spatial reasoning, and user interface design. These skills are invaluable for advanced studies in computer science and related disciplines, particularly in courses that focus on human-computer interaction and simulation. Finally, professionally, computational graphics and visualizations enable me to create engaging and interactive content. Skills like 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and visualization of complex data sets are highly sought after in industries such as game development, simulation, and data analytics.
